# Code for generating procedural color fields
I used some word embeddings and text from my thesis to generate a procedural painting to put on the cover. The code is pretty flexible and can be used to make other procedural color field works from different text, using different color schemes, and with different textures.
You can view the [included Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jvparidon/rothcoverart/blob/master/cover.ipynb) online to see examples, or download the whole repository and use the code in the notebook to make your own procedural color field art.
