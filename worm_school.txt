My favourite colour is brown. That's because mud is brown and I really, really, really like mud. My favourite things are other worms. And my hobby is digging holes in the ground. There is nothing I enjoy more than making a complicated underground tunnel system. But when I met Laurence, everything changed. Let me tell you about how I met him... I was digging a hole, like I usually do (like all worms do), but I must have fallen asleep because the next thing that happened was that I was flying a spaceship in outer space. The spaceship was made out of potatoes. Then, I dreamt I fell out of a can into a cereal bowl. Staring at me was a scruffy, fat bird who looked a lot like a chicken. It was a really good dream until it got to the bird part. The bird had intense and scary eyes. The worst thing was that the last part of the dream wasn't a dream at all. I really had been in a can and there really was a big, fat bird staring at me! What would you do if you were a worm and there was a bird two centimetres away from your face looking at you with his beak open so wide that you could see inside it? Maybe you would do what I did. I smiled a big smile and said in my most cheerful voice: "Good morning!". The bird looked confused. He mumbled "Good morning" back and then opened his beak again with his head turned at a slightly different angle.
